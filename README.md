## Project Proposal

### Definition:
Creating Movie Recommender Engine, by collecting, analyzing and modeling data from various sources and predicting the users' film preferences based on their previously watched movies..

### Anticipated Approach:
*   Data Collection for movies and their associated features.
*   Data Pre-processing.
*   Clustering for similarity using (PCA, T-SNE/SNE, K-means, DB Scan clustering).
*   Predictions based on similarity score or least distance using (KNN, Ranking algorithms).

### Anticipated Data:
*   Collecting movie data from various sources such as Kaggle, google datasets, Hugging Face data repository, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Git-Hub.

### Files Description:
*   final_data_cleaning: Jupyter Notebook code of cleaning/pre-procesing the dataset.
*   Data_Modelling: Jupyter Notebook code of modelling (PCA & k-means).
*   Data_Visualization: Jupyter Notebook code of visualization.
*   cleaned_data.csv: CSV file of the cleaned dataset.
